searchMonkey
============

For full installation instructions see:
http://searchmonkey.sf.net/index.php/Searchmonkey_Installation


For most systems simply run:
 $ ./configure
 $ make
If there are no errors reported by configure/make, as super user:
 # make install

If you are using a Gnome based distro e.g. Fedora or Suse.
 # make install-gnome
will create a launcher icon.

To uninstall, as super user:
 # make uninstall
The source code can then be removed completely, if required.

Enjoy!
