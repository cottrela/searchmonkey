searchMonkey
============

For full installation instructions see:
http://searchmonkey.sf.net/index.php/Searchmonkey_Installation

Dependencies
============

The main dependencies for Searchmonkey are:-
 > C++ Development Tools
 > gtk2 Development Libraries

For example, on CentOS these can be installed as follows:-
 # yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
 # yum install gtk2-devel

Building
========

For most systems simply run:
 $ ./configure

If there are any errors detected by the configure script, then fix and re-run configure. Once all of the missing dependencies are fixed, continue with:
 $ make

If there are no errors reported by configure/make, as super user:
 # make install

If you are using a Gnome based distro e.g. RedHat, Suse, Ubuntu, etc
 # make install-gnome
will create a launcher icon.

To uninstall, as super user:
 # make uninstall

Note - the source code can then be removed completely, if required.

Enjoy!
