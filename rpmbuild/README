Instructions for building a source/binary RPM (on FC5).

Update the spec file to match the current version and release.
Copy the appropriate spec file to /usr/src/$(DISTRO)/SPECS
In the source code folder run:
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make dist-gzip

Copy the newly created gzip file to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCE

To create a source/binary RPM run (as root):

 # rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/searchmonkey-$(VERSION)-1.spec

Fingers crossed, the RPMS/i386 and SRPMS folder should now contain distributable RPM files!

Enjoy!

p.s. Note that searchmonkey.desktop is an application launcher. Copy it to /usr/share/applications for GNOME systems.
